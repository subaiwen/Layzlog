Especially for models with interactions:
1. Centering by subtracting the mean of the data

2. Using a conventional centering point

The residual standard deviation and R2 do not change—linear transformation of the predictors does not affect the fit of a 
classical regression model—and the coefficient and standard error of the interaction do not change, but the main effects and 
the intercept move a lot and are now interpretable based on comparison to the mean/the conventional point of the data.

3. Standardizing
scale the difference
